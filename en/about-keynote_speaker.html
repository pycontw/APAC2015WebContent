His research interests include scientific computing and both the analytical and computational study of nanophotonic media (such as photonic crystals and metamaterials) for both classical and quantum phenomena. He is the co-author of nearly 200 papers and three books. SGJ was the co-recipient of the 1999 J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software due to his work on the FFTW library, and has since then developed several popular free/open-source packages for technical computing, including MPB, Meep, and NLopt, as well as contributing to <a href="http://www.scipy.org">SciPy</a> and other free software. He is active in the development of the new technical-computing language, <a href="http://julialang.org">Julia</a>, and will introduce Julia at PyCon along with the ways in which Julia benefits from and interoperates with Python.

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h3>Autobiography</h3>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/vanl">Van Lindberg</a> has worked professionally as an engineer, as a lawyer, and as an executive. He currently has a dual legal/technical role at <a href="http://www.rackspace.com"></a>Rackspace, and has worked out of both the legal department and the Office of the CTO. In April 2012, the American Bar Association Journal named Van as one of "America's Top 12 Techiest Attorneys." He has been involved with open source since 1994, when a friend introduced him to Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the legal side, Van leads Rackspace's Intellectual Property program, directing Rackspace's strategy and policy around patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and open source matters. Van also heads Rackspace's lobbying efforts relative to patent reform.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the technical side, Van runs Rackspace's technical leadership corps, known internally as the "TCT." Van also works in technical strategy and ecosystem engagement at Rackspace, identifying emerging technologies, separating out differentiating versus non-differentiating product elements, and using open source strategies to be more competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, Van worked at the law firm of Haynes and Boone, where he wrote "Intellectual Property and Open Source," published by O'Reilly and Associates, and grew an open source practice helping businesses with everything from open source compliance to business strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to Van's open source practice, he did IP transactional work, patent prosecution, litigation, and post-grant actions (ex parte and inter partes reexams/reviews).
        </p>
        <p>
          Van currently serves as chairman of the board of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>, on the board of the <a href="https://www.openstack.org">OpenStack Foundation</a>, and as the chair of the <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> Governance Advisory Board.

      <p><a href="http://www.kennethreitz.org">Kenneth Reitz</a> is a versatile talent computer genius. Kenneth has a well-understood on Photography and has released many masterpieces on famous photo sharing platforms such as flickr and 500px. But most important, Kenneth is a grand Open Source software contributors who invents and leads many popular github projects. The most widely used one is <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests">Requests</a>, a revolutionary package that allows tens of thousands Python Web Developers to develop Web services with human-friendly syntax instead of using the tedious , trivial urllib which Python standard library provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Kenneth has a groundbreaking stride in Python Web Development, he is always a kind Python mentor for novice and expert Python developers. Under Kenneth's lead, the Github project <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide">"python-guide"</a> has abundant resources helping many beginners to break the programming ice. On the other side, for the experts, Kenneth has established many great practices for writing good code, including project structuring, coding style, documentation and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kenneth embraces the elegant Architectures and APIs. Hence, Kenneth founded KennethReitz.com to provide Architecture solutions for numerous enterprises. In 2011, Kenneth joined the <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> team for developing the best Python offering and playing a Heroku's voice in Python Community. Also, Kenneth is one of the fellows in Python Software Foundation.
